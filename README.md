## Some Features of my project
* I have created a Automotive category website. My website homepage has a navbar, banner, footer and some important sections. I made the navbar sticky.

* I have added two more routes relevant to my website apart from home page. And kept those routes as private routes. If a user is not logged in and wants to access those routes, the page will redirect him to the login page.

* If the user has not registered on our page before then he can go to the register route by toggling from the login route.

* If the user enters less than six passwords or does not enter an uppercase or special character in the password, an error message will be displayed on the page. 
And a sweet alert will show on the page when the user completes the registration or login correctly.

* When the user completes the registration or login, his name and picture will be shown in the navbar. And he can go to private routes.

* i have implemented a dark and light theme toggle on check button in navbar.
